  Java Specification Requests (JSRs) are the actual descriptions of proposed and final specifications for the Java platform. At any one time there are numerous JSRs moving through the review and approval process.

  A simple way to stay up to date and track the JSRs in each stage of review is to join the Mailing List. As a Mailing List member, you can automatically receive emails on JSRs as they move through the stages in review.

  Of course, at any time, you can see a list of all JSRs, by visiting the Java Specification Requests list. Using the links near the top of the page, you can sort the list by JSR ID number, Title, and the Spec Lead Company Name.

  You can also view JSRs by Stage, Technology & Platform or Executive Committee.
